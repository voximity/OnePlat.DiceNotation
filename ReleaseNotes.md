# Release Notes
These are the release notes for our various updates. You can see how the library has evolved and the latest capabilities.

### Current (1.0.4):
* Added tracking service to keep track of die rolls to provide statistical data.
* Added abstract RandomDieRollerBase class for shared code between all random rollers, so those classes can just implement minimally the number generation.
* Added two new die rollers: SecureRandomDieRoller and MathNetDieRoller.

### Release 1.0.3:
* Added value converters for DiceResult and TermResultList to help with default display of these classes as text.
* Two bug fixes:
    - Added IDice.Clear method to allow dice to be reused with new expressions (without needing to recreating instance).
    - Dice.Parse now throws an exception if null or empty string is used.

### Release 1.0.2:
* Added support percentile (d%) notation. 
* Added support for dropping lowest N dice (similar to keeping highest N dice). 
* Added support for Fudge/FATE dice notation. 
* Added support for exploding or pentrating dice rolls. 
* Added support for default dice sides (3d =>3d6), and ability to set default number of sides as dice config.

### Release 1.0.1:
* Added general purpose parser to handle more math and dice expressions.
* Added support for grouping using ( ). Now you can parse dice expressions like - (2+1)d4 - (4-2).
* Test validation for new expressions and grouping.

### Release 1.0.0:
* Initial release with dice notation support, parsing of notation strings, and evaluating die rolls and math operations into a result.
